This won second place in the MLH Hack At Home hackathon.

Pac-Man Escape is a math puzzle game where the player is given a grid with goal points laid out on it. The player must write a mathematical function that creates a curve for Pac-Man to follow in order to eat all the goals while avoiding the ghosts. It is comprised of several levels, each getting progressively more difficult and requiring more knowledge of different kinds of math functions.
